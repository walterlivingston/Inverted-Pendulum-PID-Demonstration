# Inverted Pendulum PID Demonstration
This was the final project for Applied Mechatronics(MECH 5970) at Auburn University. The project was meant to reflect the four major concepts learned in the class: Sensing, Actuation, Computation, and Mechanical Design.  For this project, an inverted pendulum controlled by a variable PID controller was chosen.  This project was meant to be a demonstration for the professor's Systems & Dynamic Controls(MECH 3140) course.
